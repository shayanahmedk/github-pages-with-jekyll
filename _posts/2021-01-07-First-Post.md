Hello!!
I have made this blog using Jekyll and this is hosted on GitHub Pages.
This is my first post on my blog.
I have created a repo and have set up the blog, i have also edited and made a new pull request and a new branch.
I am currently on the new branch.
This is a summary of all the work i have done currently.
Thank you!
